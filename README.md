This project contains numerical examples for this article "Computing f-Divergences and Distances of High-Dimensional Probability Density Functions -- Low-Rank Tensor Approximations", available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07164
#
The user needs, first, to install TT-Toolbox from here https://github.com/oseledets/TT-Toolbox 
Then to run TT-Toolbox/setup.m
Only after that the user can run single Matlabs files from this repository
